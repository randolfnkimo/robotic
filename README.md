# Robotic Application: Direct Kinematics, Denavit-Hartenberg, and Jacobian Computation

## Description

This repository contains code for a robotic application focusing on direct kinematics, Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for the robot, and Jacobian computation. The code is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding and implementation of these concepts for robotic manipulation.

## Features

- **Direct Kinematics**: Calculate the end-effector pose given joint angles and link parameters.
- **Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters**: Define the kinematic structure of the robot using DH parameters.
- **Jacobian Computation**: Compute the Jacobian matrix for the robot to analyze its manipulability and perform tasks such as inverse kinematics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```
2. Run the program in Matlab
```
MGD.m
Jacobien.m
```
## Usage

1. Modify the configuration files or input parameters as needed to define the robot's kinematic structure and joint values.
2. Run the program to calculate direct kinematics, Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, or Jacobian matrix based on the implemented functionalities.
3. Analyze the output to understand the robot's pose, kinematic structure, or manipulability for further applications.
